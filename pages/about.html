      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Alignment Theory is a research framework concerned with the conditions under which human agency stabilizes or collapses.

Across domains—psychology, morality, religion, politics, technology, and organizational life—people routinely experience a gap between what they know and what they can sustain. Insight increases, but coherence does not. Rules proliferate, but responsibility weakens. Certainty hardens while internal regulation erodes.

Alignment Theory approaches this pattern as a structural problem, not a moral failure or a deficit of intelligence.

The framework proposes that many forms of human suffering emerge when external systems of control (rules, incentives, identities, fear, shame, institutions) outpace an individual’s capacity for internal regulation. Under sufficient load, agency is outsourced. When this persists, fragmentation, reactivity, and dependency increase—even in highly educated or well-intentioned individuals.

Rather than prescribing beliefs or behaviors, Alignment Theory describes:

how external moral regulation functions,

how internal moral regulation develops,

why external control scales faster than integration,

and what conditions allow internal alignment to re-emerge.

This site functions as a research archive rather than a platform or program. It contains manuscripts, essays, documents, and conceptual tools produced while developing and refining the framework. Materials are presented as artifacts—dated, versioned, and limited in scope—rather than as finalized doctrine.

Alignment Theory is not a religion, a political ideology, a therapeutic modality, or a self-improvement system. It does not claim to resolve metaphysical questions or eliminate uncertainty. Its purpose is narrower: to clarify the architecture of moral development and the constraints that govern human agency under pressure.

The archive is maintained as an ongoing record of inquiry.</p>
